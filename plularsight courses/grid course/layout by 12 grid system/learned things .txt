we create 12 grids by 
grid-template-columnsrepeat(12,1fr);
 the rows are as per the content.

i.e grid-auto-rows:min-content;
  means the rows are as small as possible to fit the content inside
 
by this we can set the desired height of the each item
and as per the min-content the item will fit nicely.
