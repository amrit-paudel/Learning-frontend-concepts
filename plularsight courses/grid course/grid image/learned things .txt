making grid by grid items of perfect square 
spanning nicely
using 
img{
  width:100%;
  height:100%;
  object-fit:cover;
}                         is very crucial, otherwise don't work properly

let say we use like
img{
   display:block;
   max-width:100%;               it won't work, and is almost impossible to style and fit nicely to grid.
}

and creation of nice grid is very very important, all the grid cells must be square or close to square...
like.....
grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(100px,1fr));
grid-auto-rows:100px;
